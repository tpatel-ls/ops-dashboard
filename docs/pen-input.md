# Pen and stylus

Pen input is a first class citizen. Touch is for panning and zooming. Mouse
is for desktop. The whiteboard reads them all through the Pointer Events API.

## Reading the pen

```ts
canvas.addEventListener('pointerdown', (e) => {
  if (e.pointerType !== 'pen') return;
  ink.begin({
    x: e.clientX,
    y: e.clientY,
    pressure: e.pressure,   // 0 to 1
    tiltX: e.tiltX,         // -90 to 90
    tiltY: e.tiltY,
    twist: e.twist,         // 0 to 359
  });
});
```

## Palm rejection

Whenever a pen pointer is active, ignore touch pointers for the next 200 ms.
`@ops-dashboard/whiteboard` exports `shouldRejectAsPalm` for this. The window resets
on every pen sample so a resting palm stays rejected.

## Side button as eraser

Most Samsung S-Pens fire `button === 5` when the side button is held during a
stroke. Feature detect by reading `e.button` on `pointerdown` and switch the
active tool to eraser for the lifetime of that stroke.

## Hover preview

The S-Pen reports `pointermove` while hovering above the screen with
`pressure === 0`. Render a small cursor at the pen tip so the user knows
where the next stroke will begin.

## Gestures alongside pen

Two finger pan and pinch zoom must keep working while a pen stroke is in
flight. Track touches and pen pointers separately.

## Lefty mode

Settings has a `leftyMode` toggle. When true, the whiteboard toolbar mirrors
to the right edge so a right handed palm is no longer in the way of a left
handed pen.
